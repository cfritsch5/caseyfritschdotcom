      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>If the saying goes the more you know the more you realize how much
        you don't know, then I want to know enough to have some incling of
        how little I know in both knowledge and human experience. I would
        like to use my intelligence, technical expertise, and problem solving
        skills to undermine the great injustices of society, and I have been
        described as articulate, highly organized, an excellent listener, and a
        humanitarian. I act to leave a legacy of kindness that resonates past my
        own influence and makes the world a better place.

        <p> I am using free online resourses like Duolingo and LearnSpanish,
          and have committed to practicing every day. I am focusing on Spanish
          because it is both a widely used language nationally and internationally,
          and is fairly accesable from english. One of my life goals is to
          learn another language fluently and spend at least a year living in
          a country that uses it as the main language. I believe that this would
          be great experience to learn and appreciate how little I know of how
          people live around the world, from small nuances to vast gulfs of
          cultural communication or resources.

        <p> I participated in the 2016 GoodReads Reading Challenge to encourage
          myself to read and grow. I love reading, not only to learn factual
          information, but to also grow as a person and stand in the shoes of
          others. In January I set my goal for 32 books, and intentionally read
          books from diverse perspectives. I surpased my original goal and was
          able to complete 37 books. My goal for 2017 is to increase my reading
          goal from 32 to 52, a rate of one book a week, and write a short review
          of each one to give back into a system I benefit from as well as help
          me understand and remember the content. </p>

            <p> The Human Library is a project
              that aims to start conversations in the community to better understand
              the other side of stereotypes, discrimination, and bias. Each event
              gathers readers, general members of the community, and books, people
              in the communtiy who have a life experience or identity that is
              misunderstood in our society, to have respectful and open conversations.
              I volunteered independantly in March, and created a partnership between
              The Human Library Chicago and The Residence and Greek Life office at
              Illinois Institute of Technology to set up the collaborative event on
              campus in April. I participated as a book in both the March and April
              2015 events talking about my expeirience being transgender.</p>

                work full time as mentors and tutors to support students learning and growth.
                I proudly served with City Year Sacramento for the 2015-2016 year in
                a 9th grade Algebra 1 classroom.</p>
